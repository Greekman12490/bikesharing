### Now, when we consider the trips by hour during the weekdays, we notice that during the rush hours (6:00 A.M - 10:00 AM)(4:00 P.M - 8:00 P.M) of each weekday, there are a significant amount of trips than that of non rush-hours. During the weekends, however, it shows an even distribution throughout the day when it comes to trips.

## Summary
### When we look at the data above, we notice overall that many people use Citibike within NYC. Not only that, more men use it than any other gender. If investors were to consider building Citibike stations within Des Moines, they need to consider the target audience. With the assumption it may be male, however, encouraging other genders to use the bike can help. Now, considering that Citibike has a huge subscription base, investors can push for intitives to help increase that base and/or sales. We can visualize how many people are using Citibike via subscription. Not only that, we can also visualize which gender is subsribed.
